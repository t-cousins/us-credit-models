I thought it would be interesting to analyse the data from this, now closed, 2012 [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/benchmark-bond-trade-price-challenge).

The aim was to predict trade prices of US IG & HY corporate bonds. I have developed several models that combine real-time TRACE data with standard yield-curve models to more accurately predict corporate bond prices.
